# PowerScriptCollection 

__A custom collection of powershell functions, scripts and code snippets.__  

I firmly believe that structured data can be incredibly useful, providing solutions and improvements for both personal and professional tasks. With just a few PowerShell functions, I have been able to achieve this efficiently.  

One of the key tools is [ConvertFrom-TextTable](#convert-texttable-to-object), which excels at transforming unstructured data into structured, machine-readable formats. Additionally, [Join-Objects](#join-powershell-objects) and [Rename-NoteProperty](#rename-noteproperty-of-objects) help me merge objects and standardize object properties, ensuring consistency.  

Perhaps the most __practical and effective__ function Iâ€™ve developed is [ConvertTo-MSSQL](#convert-objects-to-mssql) .  
It allows me to store all this valuable data in SQL databases, where the truly interesting data analysis begins.
